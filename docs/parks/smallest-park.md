THE BRAND-NEW "PAWNEE PARK"

**State Record Holder**
: Smallest Park in Indiana!

What this park lacks in size, it makes up for in... lack of size! That's right; move over Terryville, because the smallest park in the state of Indiana just landed in Pawnee!

This park sits on a very unique site, not just as the location of Pawnee's last remaining telephone booth, but also as the only area in Pawnee bigger than three feet in diameter to have witnessed zero Native American atrocities.

So, come one, come all - but no more than three (maximum capacity) - and see for yourself what many passersby are calling "a small park."

According to Leslie Knope, the park is 0.000003 square miles and was created when the last remaining phone booths in Pawnee were torn down. Martin Luther King, Jr. Park in Terryville was previously the smallest park in Indiana.
