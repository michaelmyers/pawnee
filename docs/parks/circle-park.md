Conceived in 1897, Circle Park was named so because the park is a near-perfect circle. Over the years, the Park's boundary lines have been redrawn so it now more closely resembles a long, thin landing strip, but the name lives on.

In the 1980s, Circle Park, like the rest of the country, fell on hard times. There were reports of gang violence, and drug use. But that was twenty years ago! Don't believe the bad press. But just to be safe, maybe take your biggest friend, and review all of your rights under the recently-updated Pawnee Knife Codes.

In an effort to clean up Circle Park, the Parks and Recreation Department recently vowed to turn every discarded tire thrown into the park into a tire swing. There are now over 200 tire swings. The park is pretty much just tire swings.
