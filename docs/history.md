In 1812, Reverend Luther Howell of Terre Haute traveled over 100 miles by pushcart and planted a flag in the ground. That soil, formerly inhabited by the Wamapoke Indian tribe, was to become Pawnee. Rev. Howell was soon dispatched by the tribe, but not before consecrating the town's first church, Pawnee Lutheran, which still stands today, though it was deconsecrated in 1974 and is currently a wholesale linen outlet.

In 2014, the neighboring town of Pawnee, and the county seat of Wamapoke County, Eagleton, was de-incorporated and reabsorbed into Pawnee (citing bankruptcy issues) as part of the Pawnee-Eagleton merger. Subsequently, Pawnee became the county seat of Wamapoke County. The section of Pawnee formerly known as Eagleton is now recognized as the community of “Old Eagleton.”
