The Pawnee City Council consists of five members. It has the power over city budgets, ordinances and resolutions.

The Pawnee City Council Meetings meet at 7 pm at the first and third Wednesday of every month unless otherwise noted.

Minutes of council meeting are only available to public online, as we strive to make Pawnee green.

If you wish to attend the council meetings, please remember that cell phones, cigarettes, animals, weapons, alcohol, tape recorders, digital cameras, laser pointers, toy guns, food, paint, or fireworks are not allowed on the premises. Also, there is a strict dress code. Shirts, pants and shoes must be worn. Citizens wearing halter-tops or jean shorts will be turned away. Due to a recent scare, all raccoons, live and stuffed, as well as taxidermy of all animals, are banned as well.
