## Animal Control

Animal Control is now a sub-department of Parks and Recreation. You can find our latest most wanted bulletin of high profile pests [here](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/parksandrecreation/images/b/ba/PawneeMostWantedPests.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20111016180532).

### Pests

The North American raccoon (Procyon lotor) inhabits suburban and urban areas around the world. These masked bandits are cute on the outside, but many are contaminated with leptospirosis, listeriosis, tetanus and tularemia on the inside. Pawnee's raccoon problem is well documented. Due to massive overpopulation, these animals are now considered pests and must be eradicated. The city has established the Raccoon Eradication Initiative (REI) for this purpose.
